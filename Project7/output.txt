===== New GP online booking system 'risks patient safety', doctors warn
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqje8dljz7eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

The doctors union, the British Medical Association (BMA), has warned that potentially serious health problems could be missed by GPs, and lead to patients being harmed, when a new online booking system is launched across England on Wednesday.
But Health Secretary Wes Streeting says ministers are putting the interests of patients first and had already agreed clear safeguards with the union.
The system will allow patients wanting an on-the-day GP appointment, or a call from a clinician, to make a request online throughout the day.
The facility is already available in many practices and is designed to reduce long waits on the phone during the so-called '8am scramble'.
The BMA says the government must halt the rollout of the online booking plan to allow changes to be put in place.
The union argues that online systems cannot distinguish adequately between urgent and non-urgent patient messages, and this could lead to potentially serious cases being delayed.
The BMA has also warned there would be a "potential online triage tsunami" with no additional workforce to cope with the extra demand.
Union leaders say more should be done to provide safeguards, such as allowing practices to temporarily switch off the online booking mechanism if staff are struggling to handle patient numbers.
The union has warned that if the government does not amend the scheme, a formal dispute will be declared. This could lead to a "work to rule" situation, similar to what was introduced in a previous dispute during which GPs limited patient appointments to the minimum required under their contract.
But ministers argue that the BMA had agreed to the introduction of online booking as part of a new negotiated contract in England. They point out that many GPs already offer the service.
Wes Streeting, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, said it was "absurd" that in 2025 many patients can't request appointments online.
"If you can book a hair appointment online, you should be able to book an NHS appointment too. We have agreed clear safeguards, where patients will be directed to phone up or attend in person for urgent appointments. The BMA knows this. This government will always put the interests of patients first, and we will not stand for our NHS being held back in the analogue age."
Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of the BMA GP committee, said the changes were agreed to "on the condition that 'necessary safeguards' would be put in place" before Wednesday 1 October.
"This was agreed – in writing – with government… and NHSE in February this year. Now almost eight months later, it is deeply disappointing to see promises broken," she added.
She said ministers had been warned that the changes would lead to "hospital-style waiting lists in general practice" which could "reduce face-to-face GP appointments".
Mr Streeting said that that 2,000 extra GPs had already been hired across England and that patient satisfaction with their GPs was on the up.
Officials said that surgeries which had implemented the changes had reported reduced waiting times for appointments.


===== Maintenance grants to return for some students
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c749vnylk1jo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Maintenance grants will return for some university students in England by 2029, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said.
The grants will apply to "tens of thousands" of students from lower-income households, targeted at those "studying priority courses that support the industrial strategy and the Labour government's wider mission to renew Britain".
The government said the new grants would be funded by a tax on international student fees, which will only apply to higher education providers in England.
Universities UK, which represents 141 institutions, said bringing back grants was "the right idea – but this would be executing it in the wrong way".
"Universities already contribute a huge amount to government priorities and if, after more than a decade of effectively freezing domestic fees, the government wants them to do more, it's time we had a debate about making a greater contribution from the public purse," chief executive Vivienne Stern said.
It is not yet clear which "priority courses" students would have to be on to be eligible for a grant, with the government saying more details would be provided in November's autumn Budget .
Maintenance grants were abolished 10 years ago by the former chancellor George Osborne, who said they had become an "unaffordable" cost to the taxpayer.
At the time, students from families with annual incomes of £25,000 or less could get a full grant of £3,387 a year.
More than half a million students in England were receiving a grant before they were removed, at a cost of £1.57bn a year.
Unlike maintenance loans, which students have to repay with interest, maintenance grants do not have to be paid back.
Speaking at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool on Monday afternoon, Phillipson said the government was putting universities "back in the service of working-class young people".
"Conference, their time at college or university should be spent learning or training, not working every hour God sends," she said.
The government said the maintenance grants would be available to students doing university degrees, other higher education courses, and technical qualifications.
The government has not yet said how much money eligible students will be able to receive in the grant, but - like maintenance loans, which students in England can still receive - the amount will be means-tested, meaning it depends how much a student's family earns.
It comes as a growing number of students are having to take on part-time work to fund their time at university, as the gap continues to increase between the rising cost of living and the money available from maintenance loans.
Recent research from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) suggests students in England need £61,000 over a three-year degree "to have a minimum socially acceptable standard of living".
The think tank found the maximum annual maintenance loan covers "just half the costs faced by freshers".
And a recent Save the Student survey suggested that, on average, maintenance loans have been falling £502-a-month short of living costs.
Tom Allingham, student money expert at Save the Student, welcomed the announcement, but said the government should "think bigger" by making all students eligible, rather than just those on "priority courses".
"Simply replacing a chunk of the loan with a grant will make no difference to the intense financial struggles students face, and the number one thing they need right now is more money in their pockets," he said.
"We eagerly await more details on the new funding, and hope the government will listen to the needs of students when fine-tuning their plans."
Alex Stanley, from the National Union of Students, said the reintroduction of grants "has to be the beginning of wholesale change in our broken education system".
Although they "do not welcome the introduction of a levy on international students", he said they were "ecstatic that maintenance grant funding is back on the table".
Hepi's Nick Hillman similarly said the return of grants was "long overdue", but that the tax on international student fees was "not the right way to do it".
"We should not be charging international students, who often come from countries much poorer than the UK, to cover the living costs of our own home students," he said.
When it comes to maintenance loans, the maximum yearly amount students from England can receive if they are living away from their parents, outside of London, is £10,544.
Students from Wales studying away from home can borrow up to £11,345, and some Welsh students are already entitled to maintenance grants.
In Scotland, the maximum annual maintenance loan is £9,400 for under-25s, and there is a number of bursaries and grants students there can apply for too.


===== MrBeast defends trapping man in burning building for chance to win $500,000
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cder5l8pw8lo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

MrBeast, the world's biggest YouTuber, has defended his latest stunt video - "Would You Risk Dying for $500,000 (£372,000)" - which shows a professional stuntman escape a blazing building while collecting bags of cash.
The fiery spectacle sparked fury, as some online suggested it was dangerously irresponsible and could put viewers who might copy the clip at risk.
In response to the criticism, MrBeast - real name Jimmy Donaldson - said  "I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine."
Donaldson has more than 440 million subscribers on YouTube and is believed to be its highest-paid creator. His business ventures also include fast food and an Amazon TV gameshow, Beast Games.
The video, first posted to YouTube on Saturday , currently has more than 45 million views. In it, Eric, the contestant, takes on seven "death traps" including getting shot out of a cannon into some fire, "surviving" massive explosions, as well as escaping from what appears to be a mock-up of a small house.
The dramatic but highly produced scenes in the video prompted condemnation online, with social media users calling it dystopian and "humiliating".
But some did highlight it was unlikely Eric was ever in any real danger, with at least one other describing it as "a PR stunt".
Eric eventually completed the challenges with a haul of $350,000 (£260,000).
Reacting to the backlash, MrBeast said: "This blew up, if you're curious obviously we had ventilation for the smoke and a kill switch to cut off the fires.
"We had professionals test this extensively and the guy in the video as stated is a professional stunt man. I take safety more serious than you could ever imagine", he said on social media platform X on Monday.
A pinned comment on the original YouTube video added: "We also had a pyro team [specialists in fire effects] controlling the fires and multiple fire suppression methods on every challenge to ensure we could essentially turn off the fire if there was ever an issue.
"But our stunt coordinator did an amazing job as always, and none of these systems were ever needed. Just wanted to be transparent with you all since I saw some concern!"
As one of the most popular content creators on the planet, MrBeast has a number of other business ventures and last year hosted Beast Games , an Amazon series which saw 1,000 people competing in a series of elimination challenges for a $5m (£3.9m) cash prize.
But the series was named in a lawsuit where some contestants claimed they'd been "exploited" during filming - allegations Donaldson said had been " blown out of proportion ".
In May, the Mexican government accused him of "exploiting" the Mayan pyramids for a video and the month before he had to apologise when fans had a "horrible" experience at a Las Vegas event in his name.


===== JK Rowling dismisses Emma Watson as 'ignorant' over trans rights row
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7012ryvyyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

JK Rowling has sent a stinging response to Emma Watson after the Harry Potter actress recently spoke about their relationship and a public disagreement over the issue of gender identity.
Last week, Watson said she still loves Rowling and refuses to "cancel her out" despite their differences on the subject.
But on Monday, the author responded by saying her own feelings towards her "former friend" had soured after she says Watson publicly poured "petrol on the flames" of the debate at the peak of threats against her.
Rowling wrote on X : "Like other people who've never experienced adult life uncushioned by wealth and fame, Emma has so little experience of real life she's ignorant of how ignorant she is."
Watson, 35, played Hermione Granger in the eight films based on Rowling's books between 2001 and 2011.
She and Daniel Radcliffe were among the stars who distanced themselves from Rowling when the author sparked a row by speaking out against trans activism, which Rowling said had eroded the concept of biological sex.
The writer was accused of being transphobic, which she denied, saying she was worried about the effect on women in single-sex spaces.
In an interview last week, Watson said: "It's my deepest wish that I hope people who don't agree with my opinion will love me, and I hope I can keep loving people who I don't necessarily share the same opinion with."
In her new post on Monday, Rowling wrote: "I'm not owed eternal agreement from any actor who once played a character I created. The idea is as ludicrous as me checking with the boss I had when I was twenty-one for what opinions I should hold these days."
She said it had been, however, "hard to shake a certain protectiveness" after knowing someone since they were 10.
"Until quite recently, I hadn't managed to throw off the memory of children who needed to be gently coaxed through their dialogue in a big scary film studio."
The author said the "turning point" in her feelings came in 2022 when Watson appeared to aim a subtle dig at Rowling on stage at the Bafta Awards.
Host Rebel Wilson introduced Watson by saying: "She's proud to call herself a feminist, but we all know she's a witch." Watson responded that she was "here for ALL of the witches", which was widely interpreted as a statement of support for the trans community.
Rowling said that moment had "a postscript that hurt far more than the speech itself", when Watson sent a note, despite having her phone number. The note had a single line saying, "I'm so sorry for what you're going through", Rowling said.
"This was back when the death, rape and torture threats against me were at their peak, at a time when my personal security measures had had to be tightened considerably and I was constantly worried for my family's safety," the author said.
"Emma had just publicly poured more petrol on the flames, yet thought a one line expression of concern from her would reassure me of her fundamental sympathy and kindness."
Rowling went on to suggest that Watson was "never likely to need" to use the types of single-sex spaces she has campaigned against trans people having access to, such as changing rooms and public toilets.
"I wasn't a multimillionaire at fourteen. I lived in poverty while writing the book that made Emma famous," she added.
"I therefore understand from my own life experience what the trashing of women's rights in which Emma has so enthusiastically participated means to women and girls without her privileges."
The writer added that Watson's recent declaratons of love marked a "change of tack I suspect she's adopted because she's noticed full-throated condemnation of me is no longer quite as fashionable as it was".
Rowling concluded: "Adults can't expect to cosy up to an activist movement that regularly calls for a friend's assassination, then assert their right to the former friend's love, as though the friend was in fact their mother.
"Emma is rightly free to disagree with me and indeed to discuss her feelings about me in public - but I have the same right, and I've finally decided to exercise it."
BBC News has approached Watson's representatives for comment.
Watson was one of several stars of the Potter films who spoke out against Rowling's views in 2020, posting on social media at the time: "Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren't who they say they are."
In last week's interview, Watson said her previous relationship with Rowling meant she was still able to "treasure Jo".
The actress also praised Rowling for the "kindness and words of encouragement" she gave when she was growing up, and for the opportunity to play a character like Hermione.
"There's just no world in which I could ever cancel her out, or cancel that out, for anything," Watson said. "It has to remain true. It is true.
"I just don't know what else to do other than hold these two seemingly incompatible things together at the same time and just hope maybe they will one day resolve or co-join themselves, and maybe accept that they never will, but that they can both still be true."


===== Trump considering supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles, Vance says
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly6r1mg34yo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

The US is considering a request by Ukraine for long-range Tomahawk missiles, US Vice-President JD Vance has said.
However, Vance added President Donald Trump would be making "the final determination" on the matter.
Kyiv has long been calling for its Western partners to provide it with weapons that could hit major Russian cities far from the front line, arguing that they would help Ukraine seriously weaken Russia's military industry and bring the war to an end.
"If the cost of continuing the war for Moscow is too high, it will be forced to start peace talks," deputy defence minister Ivan Havryliuk told the BBC.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov played down Vance's suggestion, saying there was "no panacea that can change the situation on the front for the Kyiv regime."
"Whether it's Tomahawks or other missiles, they won't be able to change the dynamic," he added.
Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 km (1,500 miles), which would put Moscow within reach for Ukraine.
While Vance remained ambivalent about Ukraine's request for Tomahawks in his remarks on Sunday, the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, seemed to suggest Trump had already authorised strikes deep into Russian territory.
Asked on Fox News whether Washington had allowed Kyiv to carry out long-range strikes within Russia in specific instances, Kellogg said: "The answer is yes, use the ability to hit deep, there are no such things as sanctuaries."
Vance and Kellogg's comments match the US administration's recent change of tone in regard to the war.
After repeatedly expressing scepticism that Ukraine could continue to hold its own against Russia, last week Trump said Kyiv could "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" – a shift that reportedly even surprised Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky.
Trump is known to have been irritated by Russian President Vladimir Putin's surface willingness to discuss ending the war versus the reality of Moscow's persistent bombardments of Ukraine's cities.
On Sunday, a massive 12-hour strike involving hundreds of drones and nearly 50 missiles left four people dead in Kyiv and at least 70 injured.
Ukraine's Havryliuk told the BBC Russia was only going to further increase the intensity and severity of its aerial attacks.
To protect its skies from ballistic missiles, Kyiv has asked its Western partners for at least 10 units of Patriot surface-to-air defence systems which can detect and intercept oncoming missiles.
Asked whether the Patriot systems Trump promised over the summer were forthcoming, Havryliuk declined to be drawn into specifics but said there was "some movement in this direction".
The more drones and missiles are fired by Russia, the harder it is for Ukraine to intercept them.
Earlier this month Moscow fired a record number of more than 800 drones and missiles – the highest since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Inevitably, during such large-scale attacks the interception rate drops.
Out of the hundreds of drones used in Sunday's attack, 31 managed to hit their targets. According to President Zelensky, the majority were residential buildings and civilian facilities such as a cardiology centre in Kyiv.
As well as being more frequent and intense, aerial attacks are also becoming more dangerous as Moscow is using new and more advanced drones to break through Ukraine's air defence systems, Havryliuk said.
When Iranian-made Shahed drones were used for the first time in 2023, "they were easy to jam using our electronic warfare systems", he explained.
"Today, they use 16-channel antennas in order to pass through our jamming zones."
Havryliuk also believes they would be a way for Ukraine to stop Russian drones before they reach EU countries.
"Strengthening our air defence system is an investment into security of the entire Europe," he said, referring to the recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace .
He added that it would disrupt "Putin's plans to constantly scare Europe".
Earlier this year the Trump administration approved a new mechanism which sees European allies purchase US-made weapons for Ukraine. So far, several European countries and Canada have collectively pledged $2bn (£1.5bn).
While some of the weapons bought under the scheme have already arrived in Ukraine, Havryliuk said, the process is slower than before.
Time is a precious commodity in Ukraine, and in the last three and a half years of war Kyiv has developed a thriving defence industry, significantly increasing its production of drones, artillery shells, artillery systems and armoured vehicles.
Ukraine now produces almost 100% of First Person View (FPV) drones it needs and up to 40% of the front line's demand for other weapons, Havryliuk said.
On Monday Zelensky said Ukraine would continue to focus on domestically produced drones and missiles with long-range capabilities.
But until it can step up production of weapons Kyiv will remain largely dependent on its allies to provide the air defence systems it needs.
Ukraine is hoping that better protection of its cities with air defence systems combined with long-range weapons able to hit Russian targets will help bring Moscow to the negotiating table.
"Only together with our partners can we stop the Russian terror in the sky," Havryliuk said.


===== Giorgio Armani: Stars turn out for final fashion show in Milan
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw78l98lg4o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Stars including Cate Blanchett, Glenn Close and Richard Gere were in attendance for the Giorgio Armani spring/summer 2026 collection show in Milan on Sunday, the final collection the Italian designer worked on before his death.
Originally intended as a celebration of 50 years of the late designer's fashion house, the catwalk show became a tribute to Armani following his death earlier this month aged 91.
It took place at the Pinacoteca di Brera art gallery, where more than 120 of his creations are on show.
Models who had walked for the designer over the past five decades returned to showcase a mix of classic suits and glittering dresses.
They wore neutrals, greens blues and purples, evoking the light, earth and sea, the AFP news agency reported.
The collection was inspired by the northern Italian city where Armani lived and the small volcanic island of Pantelleria, where he had a holiday home.
Paper lanterns were laid across the courtyard, as they had been at a public viewing of Armani's body in Milan earlier this month , with the models walking under the portico.
"This moment, this atmosphere speaks for itself. There's a lot of memories here tonight," Blanchett told AFP.
The Oscar-winning actress also told Reuters that Armani was a "deeply human, talented individual".
The show was followed by a visit around the Giorgio Armani: Milano, Per Amore exhibition, which sees classic outfits, including Gere's suit from 1980 movie American Gigolo, set among Italian art masterpieces.
Gere and his co-star Lauren Hutton were also in attendance, as were fellow film figures Samuel L Jackson, James Norton, Toni Servillo, Zhang Ziyi and Spike Lee.
Lee told Reuters that Armani had been "an artist, humanitarian" and "a good guy".
The final dress in the show, a long-sleeved, blue glittering gown, worn by one of Armani's favourite models, Agnese Zogla, featured an image of his face, drawing a standing ovation from the 700 guests.
"This collection, the last Giorgio Armani worked on personally, is in some ways a testament to style and the close of a cycle, so that new ones may begin," the brand said in the show's notes.
Armani's niece Silvana Armani, and the late designer's partner and collaborator Leo Dell'Orco (pictured below), took a bow at the end.
Live music was performed on the piano by Italian composer Ludovico Einaudi (above).
Outgoing Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour (below) also attended the event, which effectively brought Milan Fashion Week to a close for another year.
Across town, Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci - who are currently filming The Devil Wears Prada sequel - were spotted wearing sunglasses in the front row at the Dolce & Gabbana spring/summer 2026 event.
Streep plays Miranda Priestly, loosely based on Wintour, and part of the filming for the sequel is taking place in Milan.


===== How weight-loss injections are making obesity a wealth issue
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cre5xp83394o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Three years ago, a fashion editor friend returned from Milan Fashion Week bursting with a story to tell.
Most fashion editors stayed at the same hotel, she explained, and each bedroom had its own mini fridge. After checking out, en route to the airport, a stylist in her party cried out that he'd left "an important package" in his fridge and telephoned the hotel, pleading with them not to throw it away.
"Turns out he'd forgotten his Ozempic," my editor friend whispered. We were baffled. Ozempic?
Back then, Ozempic was not part of the common lexicon. But quietly, in certain circles, this injectable drug, which is licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, was being prescribed privately and off-label for weight loss.
Flash forward to today and the picture is vastly different. "So many fashion people are on it," she tells me today. "And now they're very vocal."
Serena Williams, Elon Musk and Whoopi Goldberg have all spoken about using weight-loss injections. Some are now prescribed by the NHS, including Wegovy and Mounjaro, generating scores of headlines.
Really, this should have made it a great leveller. In theory, anyone struggling with obesity can - without the expense of a private doctor - get help to manage their weight.
Only that's not the full picture.
Thousands of NHS patients are believed to be missing out. And with the NHS tightly restricting access, some working in the field warn a two-tier system around weight-loss drugs is developing - one that's benefitting the most well-off.
Martin Fidock, who is UK managing director of Oviva, which provides Wegovy and lifestyle support to NHS patients, claims that thanks to varying thresholds of eligibility in different regions, NHS prescriptions are a "postcode lottery".
An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these drugs - but more than nine in 10 are believed to pay privately. Prices vary but it generally costs between £100 and £350 a month, depending on the dose and lifestyle support.
Then, last month, it was reported that pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly was expected to increase the list price of Mounjaro by as much as 170%.
They have since done a deal for UK distributors, meaning rises are likely to be less, and the rises don’t affect the cost to the NHS - but it has still caused concern in some quarters.
"It's scary," says Brad, a tech company worker in his 40s. He has been taking Mounjaro for a year and worries he may not be able to afford to continue.
"I've lost 20kg and want to keep using it, but it's a lot of money. It's unfair."
Nutritionists and GPs I spoke to have also expressed concerns about the broader system, and in particular whether existing health inequalities could worsen.
"We cannot allow good health to become a luxury for the wealthiest by limiting access to weight-loss drugs to those who can pay privately," argues Katharine Jenner, executive director of Obesity Health Alliance.
So could it really be that weight-loss injections - for all of their benefits - are turning obesity into a wealth issue?
Weight-loss drugs have been available on the NHS for some time, but the landscape changed significantly with the introduction of some newer medications - among them, semaglutide, marketed under the brand name Wegovy, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro.
Wegovy was first prescribed for obesity by the NHS in 2023, while Mounjaro followed earlier this year. They work in part as an appetite suppressant by mimicking a hormone, which makes people feel fuller.
Studies have suggested patients can lose as much as a fifth of their body weight.
They are licensed for people with a BMI of 27 or more for those with a health condition or above 30 for those without (adjusted for certain ethnic groups). But tougher NHS criteria are being applied, and in England and Wales the drugs are mostly restricted to those with a BMI of over 35.
Plus there are more restrictions too.
For Wegovy, local areas are making their own decisions on access.
Martin Fidock claims that in recent months a third of regional health boards have increased the BMI threshold, which he says has resulted in fewer people being able to get it. (The BBC has been unable to verify this data.)
A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant that makes Wegovy, told the BBC it is "concerned about the growing disparity" in access to NHS specialist weight management services.
"This has led to a large proportion of people needing to pay out of pocket, an option which is out of reach in areas of deprivation where obesity rates are significantly higher."
NHS England has said the differences could be related to different levels of need and other providers being more active in certain regions, but confirmed it was up to local areas to decide how much to spend.
For Mounjaro, NHS England has started it for people with a BMI above 40 who also have certain health conditions. The NHS roll-out officially began in June, but a report published earlier this month suggests that not all general practices had started offering it.
Just 18 out of 42 NHS boards across England confirmed that they'd begun prescribing it in line with the roll-out plan, according to data obtained by freedom of information requests published in the BMJ.
The NHS has previously said it is supporting the phased rollout for eligible patients and that "these represent brand-new services in primary care that are being established and scaled up over time".
But Mr Fidock believes we are seeing a "postcode lottery".
"We have got an obesity epidemic and these drugs provide us with an opportunity to tackle it in a way we have never been able to do before. But your ability to benefit is dependent largely on whether you have the means to pay."
Adding to the challenge is the fact that more people from deprived areas struggle with obesity in the first place: more than a third of people in the most deprived areas are obese – twice that of more affluent neighbourhoods.
Beyond the physical health risks - and there are many, including higher risks of cancer and heart disease, plus mental health problems - there may be social consequences too.
One US study found that obese men with a bachelor's degree earn 5% less than their thinner colleagues, while those with a graduate degree earn 14% less. For obese women it is worse still, earning 12% and 19% less respectively, based on data concerning 23,000 US workers, published in The Economist in 2023.
NHS GP Matthew Calcasola, who is also involved in a service Get a Drip, which offers weight-loss drugs privately, has his own concerns.
"We're concerned health inequality will build," he says. "GPs worry about this."
Meanwhile, a booming private market has emerged. Sara de Souza, a business analyst from Nottingham, is among those delighted that it has.
Following the birth of her son Vito in 2023, she put on 30kg. "I got to 96kg," she recalls. "Me and my husband both got into bad habits. We were so busy, we were eating junk food and having chocolates.
"I was always tired and struggled to pick up my baby. But I just couldn't lose the weight."
Sara tried dieting and went to see her GP who referred her to a lifestyle diet and activity programme. But still the pounds stuck.
At her heaviest her BMI was 37.5, but she wasn't eligible for NHS access and paid £200 a month for the drug through an app called Juniper, which also gave her diet and lifestyle advice. Within a year she had lost the full 30kg.
"It completely changed my life. I felt like a new person, alive again. It's not just how I look, it's how I feel and being able to keep up with my son."
Sara says the cost didn't impact her. "Even if it had, I'd have carried on, because of the benefits."
Not everyone feels the same. Some 18% of overweight Britons would be willing to pay for weight-loss drugs - but if they were available on the NHS, 59% said they would be keen on using them, according to new polling by communications agency Strand Partners.
And some of those willing to pay privately fear they could find themselves being priced out following the proposed price spike.
"If I'd had to pay £300 or even more, I would have really struggled to afford it," says Pete Beech, 57, from Southampton.
He weighed 18 stone and paid £160 a month for a prescription of Mounjaro to help him lose weight to qualify for an ultrasound treatment as part of his treatment for prostate cancer.
"The way the NHS is rationing these drugs has consequences beyond just obesity."
James O'Loan, head of online pharmacy Chemist4U, has already observed some people stretching themselves financially to get hold of weight-loss drugs - some have asked for payment plans, which they cannot offer.
"Some people can't move on to the higher doses because of cost," he explains.
Then there are concerns about a weight-loss drug black market, or unscrupulous dispensing.
"Some services are desperate to dispense the stuff and don't care what happens," claims Professor Richard Donnelly, editor of medical journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism. "People are just asked to fill in a quick questionnaire. There's no proper medical assessment or follow up."
He also stresses that they should not be seen as a quick fix. "They're not there to lose a bit of fat around the tummy."
Whilst generally well tolerated, there are risks of certain side effects — including nausea, constipation and diarrhoea. A study into potential serious side effects of weight loss jabs has also been launched after hundreds of people reported problems with their pancreas.
The NHS advises people never take a medicine for weight management if it has not been prescribed for them.
Some argue that the answer is, simply, to widen NHS access. The issue, of course, comes in part down to cost.
Michael Shah, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, believes that this could start to resolve itself in time.
"There are more than 160 weight-loss drugs in clinical development," he says. Once available, he predicts that the competition could push costs down across the board.
"NHS bargaining power should improve as additional players and treatments enter the space."
Earlier this year the Tony Blair Institute suggested that the drugs should be offered to everyone with BMIs over 27, arguing that it costs even more to deal with the consequences of obesity.
Obesity is estimated to cost the economy £98bn a year, according to research commissioned by the think tank, once you take into account lost productivity as well as the NHS treatment costs and the impact on the individual.
The Institute suggests a means-tested system with those entitled to free prescriptions getting it free and others self-funding or encouraging employers to share the cost.
NHS England has said it is looking at an option to "accelerate roll out to even more people in the future".
But it also pointed out that weight loss drugs should not be seen as a "magic bullet".
All of this begs a broader question - that is, in medicalising debates around tackling obesity, do we risk overlooking the wider social issue?
"By thinking we have a treatment for obesity we lose focus and stop thinking about the more difficult issues around the food industry and regulation, which are the root cause of this," warns Greg Fell, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health.
"I do have concerns about equity of access," he adds. "But I think the NHS has carefully thought about this and probably is, more or less, in the right place."
In post-war Britain, obesity was rare due to food shortages and physically demanding lifestyles – lower-income groups were more likely to suffer from malnutrition.
Only since the 1980s have obesity rates risen across all social classes, with a growing disparity between rich and poor.
It is driven by several interconnected factors. Katharine Jenner argues there needs to be more done to address one of them in particular: our "broken food system".
"People in poorer areas are surrounded by junk food advertising, more unhealthy takeaways, and face bigger barriers to buying healthy food," she says.
"Without investment in prevention, health will get worse, inequalities will widen, and the costs will fall on all of us."
How to effectively achieve that is perhaps the biggest question of all. But whatever the answer - and regardless of whether the onus really should be on the state or as others argue, the individual - it runs far deeper than the cost of a weight-loss jab.
"We live in a society that prizes freedom of choice and expression, values material wealth and tolerates vast inequality," argues Chris Rojek, sociology professor at City St George's, University of London. "In such a system, casualties are inevitable.
"It would be naïve — or even pious — to claim we can simply solve this. The answer is complex and touches the very fabric of our society."

===== Japanese brewing giant Asahi hit by cyber-attack
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjz7l1pxwgo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Japanese brewing giant Asahi has been hit by a cyber-attack that has caused a "systems failure" affecting the company's shipping and customer service operations.
Asahi said there had been no "confirmed leakage of personal information of customer data" and its European operations, including the UK, were not affected.
But the company said that its order and shipment operations in Japan and customer service operations had been suspended.
Asahi is the biggest brewer in Japan, but also owns global beer brands including Peroni, Pilsner Urquell and Grolsch. It also owns Fullers in the UK, which is brewed in West London.
Fullers produces London Pride, as well cider and soft drinks brand Cornish Orchards and craft cask brewer Dark Star.
Asahi apologised to its customers and business partners in a statement.
"We are actively investigating the cause and working to restore operations; however there is currently no estimated timeline for recovery," it said.
"The system failure is limited to our operations within Japan."
"None of Asahi's manufacturing operations in Europe, including its UK beer supply, are impacted by this incident", it added.
About half of Asahi Group Holdings' sales take place in Japan.
In a report last year, Asahi listed a cyber-attack as among the main risks it faced in the medium to short term.
It assessed that such an attack could potentially lead to an interruption of its business, create cashflow issues, and damage its brand.
In the 2024 report, the company noted a number of ways in which it was responding, including assessing the maintenance of its security system.
In the UK, a number of big businesses have been hit by cyber attacks in recent months including Harrods , Jaguar Land Rover , Marks and Spencer and the Co-op .
The BBC has asked Asahi for further detail on the impact to its Japanese operations.
In recent years, Japan's has faced a challenging domestic market, with more young people choosing not to drink.
Speaking last year, the company's chief executive Atsushi Katsuki said it was aiming to double its share of of beverages with zero or low alcohol to 20% of its overall beverage sales .


===== Disabled Post Office Horizon victim offered 15% of compensation claim
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5jqxjqj0eo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

A victim of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal who was temporarily paralysed after the stress of her ordeal has been offered 15% of her compensation claim.
Janet Skinner was wrongly convicted of false accounting in 2007 and sentenced to nine months in prison after the faulty software said £59,000 had gone missing from her branch account in Hull.
She has now received an offer of full financial redress - but it is a fraction of what she had claimed. "I cried and I cried… it's trauma on top of trauma," she told the BBC.
The government said it made every effort to make full and fair offers to all claimants.
But according to Ms Skinner's lawyer, all the high-value complex claims are being fought "tooth and nail".
"They've taken a particularly cruel approach to Janet's case," claims Simon Goldberg, from Simons Muirhead Burton.
The mother-of-two lost her home, her livelihood and served two months in prison.
A year after her release, she was back in the dock facing another jail sentence as the Post Office pursued her for failing to pay "proceeds of crime".
Less than a fortnight after the matter was resolved, she suffered a neurological collapse, was paralysed from the neck down and used a wheelchair for a year.
"My immune system had broken down, basically my body attacked itself," said Ms Skinner.
It took her two years to learn how to walk again but she has been unable to work because of ongoing problems with her health and mobility issues.
"I'm in pain all the time. It's changed my life completely," she said.
She said she misses being able to spray her deodorant or hairspray because of the damage to her hands. Her son helps with visits to the bathroom and she often has to get down the stairs on her bottom.
Her conviction was quashed in 2021 but it has taken more than four and a half years to prepare her claim, including being asked to submit five medical reports.
A hearing took place earlier this year where, according to her legal team, the Post Office finally accepted these expert reports, which concluded her ill health had been triggered by the extreme stress that she had suffered.
The size of Ms Skinner's claim has not been revealed, though it is very significant.
"The sticking points are almost every element of her claim," said Mr Goldberg.
The biggest contested issues include her loss of earnings and future care costs.
The Department for Business and Trade recently took over responsibility for delivering redress for sub-postmasters whose convictions were overturned by the courts, including Ms Skinner's case.
A spokesperson said it did not comment on individual cases, but that it took every effort to make full and fair offers. An independent dispute resolution process was available to all applicants who were not content with their offer, they said.
More than £1bn worth of compensation has already been paid out to more than 8,000 victims.
The bulk of these payouts has been in the form of uncontested fixed payouts, either £75,000 or £600,000 depending on the severity of the case.
Complex claims are proving far harder to settle. Victims and their legal teams allege government and Post Office-appointed lawyers are dragging things out to minimise payouts – something ministers consistently deny.
"It's not saving the public purse a penny. It's actually costing the public purse in the medium term," claims Ms Skinner's lawyer, arguing that hundreds of millions of pounds have already been racked up in legal fees by big City law firms handling the claims, as well as legal fees paid to victims' solicitors.
Mr Goldberg has written to Darren Jones MP, who he says was a champion of the wronged sub-postmasters while in opposition. He is now effectively the prime minister's right hand man.
"The only way to resolve this is political pressure from the very top," said Mr Goldberg.
Ms Skinner has already rejected her offer and says, if need be, she is prepared to go to court if she does not receive sufficient redress for everything that she's been through.

===== 'You'll never need to work again': Criminals offer reporter money to hack BBC
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5n903447o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Like many things in the shadowy world of cyber-crime, an insider threat is something very few people have experience of.
Even fewer people want to talk about it.
But I was given a unique and worrying experience of how hackers can leverage insiders when I myself was recently propositioned by a criminal gang.
"If you are interested, we can offer you 15% of any ransom payment if you give us access to your PC."
That was the message I received out of the blue from someone called Syndicate who pinged me in July on the encrypted chat app Signal.
I had no idea who this person was but instantly knew what it was about.
I was being offered a portion of a potentially large amount of money if I helped cyber criminals access BBC systems through my laptop.
They would steal data or install malicious software and hold my employer to ransom and I would secretly get a cut.
I had heard stories about this kind of thing.
In fact, only a few days before the unsolicited message, news emerged from Brazil that an IT worker there had been arrested for selling his login details to hackers which police say led to the loss of $100m (£74m) for the banking victim.
I decided to play along with Syndicate after taking advice from a senior BBC editor. I was eager to see how criminals make these shady deals with potentially treacherous employees at a time when cyber-attacks around the world are becoming more impactful and disruptive to everyday life.
I told Syn, who had changed their name mid-conversation, that I was potentially interested but needed to know how it works.
They explained that if I gave them my login details and security code then they would hack the BBC and then extort the corporation for a ransom in bitcoin. I would be in line for a portion of that payout.
They upped their offer.
"We aren't sure how much the BBC pays you but what if you took 25% of the final negotiation as we extract 1% of the BBC's total revenue? You wouldn't need to work ever again."
Syn estimated that their team could demand a ransom in the tens of millions if they successfully infiltrated the corporation.
The BBC has not publicly taken a position on whether or not it would pay hackers but advice from the National Crime Agency is not to pay.
Still, the hackers continued their pitch.
Syn said I would be in line for millions. "We would delete this chat for you to never be found," they insisted.
The hacker claimed they had lots of success with striking deals with insiders in previous attacks.
The names of two companies that got hacked this year were shared as examples of when a deal was struck - a UK healthcare company and a US emergency services provider.
"You'd be surprised at the number of employees who would provide us access," Syn said.
Syn said he was a "reach out manager" for the cyber-crime group called Medusa. He claimed to be western and the only English speaker in the gang.
Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service operation. Any criminal affiliate can sign up to its platform and use it to hack organisations.
According to a research report from cyber-security firm CheckPoint, Medusa's administrators are thought to operate out of Russia or one of its allied states.
"The group avoids targeting organisations within Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States and [its activity is predominantly] on Russian-language dark web forums."
Syn proudly sent me a link to a US public warning about Medusa which was put out in March. US cyber authorities said that in the four years that the group has been active, it has hacked "more than 300 victims".
Syn insisted they were serious about making a deal to secretly sell the keys to my corporation's kingdom in exchange for a hefty pay day.
You never really know who you are talking to though so I asked Syn to prove it. "You could be kids messing about or someone trying to entrap me," I suggested.
They replied with a link to Medusa's darknet address and invited me to contact them through the group's Tox - a secure messaging service loved by cyber criminals.
Syn was very impatient and ramped up the pressure on me to reply.
They sent a link to Medusa's recruitment page on an exclusive cyber-crime forum urging me to start the process of securing 0.5 bitcoin (about $55,000) in a deposit arrangement.
This was effectively them guaranteeing me this money at a minimum once I handed over my login details.
"We aren't bluffing or joking - we don't have a purpose media wise we are only for money and money only and one of our main managers wanted me to reach out to you."
They apparently chose me because they assumed I was technically minded and have high-level access to BBC IT systems (I do not). I'm still not entirely sure that Syn knew I was a cyber correspondent and not a cyber security or IT employee.
They asked me lots of questions about the BBC IT network that I wouldn't have answered even if I knew. They then sent a complicated jumble of computer code and asked me to run it as a command on my work laptop and report back what it said. They wanted to know what internal IT access I had to start planning their next steps once inside.
At this point I had been talking to Syn for three days and I decided I had taken it far enough and needed some extra advice from the BBC's information security experts.
It was Sunday morning so my plan was to talk to my team the next morning.
So I stalled for time. But Syn got annoyed.
"When can you do this? I'm not a patient person," the hacker said.
"I guess you don't want to live on the beach in the Bahamas?" they pressured.
They gave me a deadline of midnight on Monday. Then they ran out of patience.
My phone started pinging with two-factor authentication notifications. The pop-ups  were from the BBC's security login app asking me to verify that I was trying to reset the password to my BBC account.
As I held my phone in my hands, the screen filled with a new request every minute or so.
I knew exactly what this was - a hacker technique known as MFA bombing. Attackers bombard a victim with these pop ups by attempting to reset a password or login from an unusual device.
Eventually the victim presses accept either by mistake or to make the pop-ups go away. This is famously how Uber was hacked in 2022 .
Being on the receiving end was unsettling.
The criminals had taken the relatively professional conversation out of the safety of my chat app to my phone home screen. It felt like the equivalent of having criminals aggressively knocking on my front door.
I was confused at the change of tactic but too cautious to open up my chats with them in case I accidentally clicked accept. This would have given the hackers immediate access to my BBC accounts.
The security system would not have flagged it as malicious as it would have looked like a normal login or password reset request from me. After that the hackers could have begun searching out access to sensitive or important BBC systems.
As a reporter and not an IT worker, I don't have high level access to BBC systems but it was still worrying and effectively meant my phone was unusable.
I called the BBC information security team and as a precaution we agreed to disconnect me from the BBC entirely. No emails, no intranet, no internal tools, no privileges.
The bizarrely calm message from the hackers came later that evening.
"The team apologises. We were testing your BBC login page and are extremely sorry if this caused you any issues."
I explained that I was now locked out of the BBC and was annoyed. Syn insisted that the deal was still there if I wanted it. But after I didn't respond for a few days, they deleted their Signal account and disappeared.
I was eventually reinstated to the BBC system albeit with added protections to my account. And with the added experience of being on the inside of an insider threat attack.
A chilling insight into the ever-evolving tactics of cyber criminals and one that has highlighted a whole area of risk to organisations that I didn't truly appreciate until I myself was on the receiving end.

===== Gaming giant Electronic Arts bought in unprecedented $55bn deal
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4w3jzx807o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Electronic Arts (EA), one of the biggest gaming companies in the world, has agreed a deal to sell the company for $55bn (£41bn).
The consortium of buyers include Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), Silver Lake and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners.
EA is known for making and publishing best-selling games such as EA FC, formerly known as Fifa, The Sims and Mass Effect.
It is understood to be the largest leveraged buyout in history - where a significant amount of the purchase is financed by borrowing money.
The deal will take EA private - meaning all of its public shares will be purchased and it will no longer be traded on a stock exchange.
The purchase price puts a significant 25% premium on the market value of EA, valuing it at $210 per share.
EA boss Andrew Wilson, who will remain in post, said it was a "powerful recognition" of the firm's work.
"Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come," he said.
The firms buying EA will contribute approximately $36bn, with the remaining amount being financed by loans.
"EA has been open to a potential buyer to help level up for a while," industry expert Christopher Dring told the BBC.
"But an acquisition from private equity is a surprise and there's a lot of industry anxiety around this deal."
He said there were concerns that the deal would result in $20bn of debt - which would need to be paid back.
"The revenue generated by big games like EA Sports FC, Madden and Battlefield 6 will be needed to service this debt, which may impact EA's ability to invest in new games," he said.
"Other industry concerns are whether this might lead to further cuts at EA, especially if there's pressure from the private companies to deliver stronger cash flow, again to serve that debt."
It is a massive purchase of a company which has been synonymous with the gaming industry for more than 40 years.
In that time, EA has been responsible for some of the biggest game series in history. Its football titles, now known as EA FC, have sold 325 million copies since the first release in 1993.
The Sims has sold more than 200 million copies, and Need For Speed more than 150 million.
But it has also been the publisher of many other popular titles - often being the partner of choice for games in the Harry Potter and James Bond series in the past.
The purchase will be a big gaming feather in the cap of Saudi Arabia, which has been increasing its presence in the industry in recent years.
In March 2025, the nation's investment fund paid $3.5bn to purchase the gaming division of Niantic - giving it control of the hit mobile game Pokémon Go.
The purchase became part of Scopely Inc - makers of Monopoly Go - which itself was bought by PIF subsidiary Savvy Games Group for $4.9bn in 2023.
Saudi Arabia has made waves in the eSports industry, hosting major tournaments including the eSports World Cup, and it will also host 2027's planned Olympic esports Games.
The country already has stakes in other big gaming firms such as Nintendo and Take-Two Interactive, but the EA purchase marks a significant extension of its reach.
Its PIF has hundreds of billions in assets due to its oil wealth, and it is controlled by the country's prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose government has been accused of human rights violations.
A 2019 UN report stated "the state of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is responsible" for the death of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who was critical of the country's government.
Saudi Arabia has always denied this.

===== Rachel Reeves warns of harder choices to come as she hints at tax rises
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy041perldwo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Rachel Reeves has said the government is facing difficult choices, as she promised she would not take risks with the public finances.
In her speech at Labour's annual party conference in Liverpool, the chancellor pledged to keep "taxes, inflation and interest rates as low as possible".
But hinting at further tax rises in November's Budget, she said the government's choices had been made "harder" by international events and the "long-term damage" done to the economy.
Reeves is facing a difficult Budget, with economists warning tax rises or spending cuts will be needed for the chancellor to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.
Pressed over whether she would have to put up taxes in a BBC interview ahead of her speech, Reeves said "the world has changed" in the last year - pointing to wars in Europe and the Middle East, US tariffs and the global cost of borrowing.
"We're not immune to any of those things," she added.
If taxes do go up in the Budget, this prepares the ground for the government's argument for why this is necessary .
Reeves criticised previous Conservatives governments, accusing Liz Truss of sending mortgage costs "spiralling" with her mini-budget.
And in comments that will be seen as a swipe at the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, Reeves said: "There are still those who peddle the idea that we could just abandon economic responsibility and cast off any constraints on spending.
"They are wrong - dangerously so - and we need to be honest about what that choice would mean."
Burnham has continued his vocal criticism of Sir Keir Starmer during Labour's conference and has not ruled out a leadership bid.
However, he prompted a backlash from some Labour MPs after he suggested ministers were "in hock to the bond markets" - a reference to the government's self-imposed rules limiting spending and borrowing.
Despite dismissing the Tories as an "irrelevance", Reeves repeatedly used the tagline: "Don't ever let anyone tell you that there's no difference between a Labour government and a Conservative government."
Urging Labour activists to take "pride in what we are achieving", she listed some of the party's key pledges, including recruiting new neighbourhood police and opening school breakfast clubs.
Reeves also used her speech to criticise Reform UK, which has been topping opinion polls for several months, despite having only five MPs.
Labour has stepped up its attacks on the party at its conference.
"The single greatest threat to the way of life and to the living standards of working people is the agenda of Nigel Farage and the Reform Party," the chancellor said.
"Whatever falsehoods they push, whatever easy answers they peddle, however willing they are to tear communities and families apart, they are not on the side of working people."
There was one interruption to her speech, when a protester held up a Palestinian flag, and Reeves told him that Labour was "not a party of protest". Merseyside Police later said there was "no police involvement".
Coming two months ahead of the Budget, when the chancellor will set out the government's tax and spending plans, Reeves's speech was relatively light on policies.
She confirmed that young people who have been out of a job or education and receiving Universal Credit for 18 months will be offered a guaranteed paid work placement, as part of plans to tackle youth unemployment.
Those who refuse to take up the offer without a reasonable excuse will face sanctions such as losing their benefits.

===== 'No police aftercare after my husband's death' says widow
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8j2zl7v02o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

"We are still going through such a horrendous traumatic time and loss, and we're left alone to navigate it, and it's not OK."
Mimi Conder is calling for mandatory police support for families whose loved ones take their own lives.
She has started a petition calling for the introduction of Jason's Law, named after her late husband, so that bereaved families in cases similar to her own can benefit from the guidance of a family support officer (FLO).
"I just feel like I couldn't grieve because I was so overwhelmed trying to understand what the processes were," she tells the BBC.
Thames Valley Police currently employs FLOs to help explain criminal investigation processes to bereaved families, but this is not applicable in cases of suicide.
If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story you can visit BBC Action Line .
Mimi, from Chinnor, Oxfordshire, describes father-of-three Jason as the "life and soul of the party" with the "brightest blue eyes, [and] loudest cackle you could ever imagine".
"He was always there for everyone, gave his all to his family, especially his children," she says.
"He always struggled but never in my life did I think he would take his own life.
"Because he was always so charismatic and positive and if anything, he was the one lifting other people up when they were low."
When Jason died in September 2024 the family found the immediate aftermath - which involved police questioning and an inquest - confusing and intimidating.
Mimi says: "We weren't provided with any aftercare whatsoever, we weren't given any breakdown of the processes.
"We were completely left alone to the point where I had to Google what an inquest was.
"I also had to find child bereavement services for our children because we weren't even provided with the basics of where to go and who we could speak to, which is heartbreaking when you're already going through so much trauma."
Mimi says she did not expect an FLO to be a "shoulder to cry on".
Instead, the family's petition calls for trained officers to "ensure consistent support, communication, and guidance during investigations, inquests, and the immediate aftermath".
"If I had someone there... then 100% I feel like I would have been able to process it a lot quicker than I did, or am still doing," she explains.
The government responds to all petitions that get more than 10,000 signatures.
Thames Valley Police said: "We recognise the enormous impact suicides have on families, and Thames Valley Police follow National Police Chiefs' Council guidance for deployment of FLOs.
"Suicides are investigated on behalf of the appropriate coroner and are not considered to be suspicious deaths, and so a FLO deployment is not generally required."

===== Ryder Cup 2025: How Luke Donald masterminded Europeâs victory over United States at Bethpage - BBC Sport
URL: https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cdjzm0p3gjdo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

This video can not be played
How a dramatic end to the Ryder Cup unfolded
On the day President Trump visited the Ryder Cup, a homemade banner was tacked to a hospitality box alongside the 18th fairway at Bethpage.
"In Donald we trust," it read.
The message was not aimed at the US President.
The blue and yellow sign hailed European leader Luke Donald, who underlined the point by becoming only the fourth captain in history to win back-to-back Ryder Cups.
When Trump met Donald on Friday, the politician told the 47-year-old Englishman he was a "great leader".
Unsurprisingly, everyone at Bethpage agreed after Europe secured their rare away win on Sunday.
"Luke is the captain of this ship, and he's led us better than I can see anybody leading us. He set the bar extremely high for the future captains," said Spain's Jon Rahm as his team-mates nodded in agreement.
Beaten US captain Keegan Bradley described Donald as the "best European Ryder Cup captain ever" - although Tony Jacklin might have something to say about that claim.
Donald, who was a late replacement for LIV defector Henrik Stenson before Europe's 2023 win in Rome, is only the second man to lead Europe to home and away victories after Jacklin in 1985 and 1987.
"I think he turned this European team into a really unstoppable force," added Bradley.
"He put his team in the best position to win, and to do that at these two places is a remarkable feat."
Following Europe's stellar success in New York, BBC Sport analyses how Donald masterminded it.
Luke Donald is only the second European Ryder Cup captain to lead the side to home and away victories
When Donald led his side to success in Rome, the clamour immediately began for him to stay on in the captaincy.
Chants of "two more years" - from both his celebrating players and jubilant fans - echoed around the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club.
Their wish was granted when Donald's second term was confirmed that November.
Since his initial appointment three years ago, he has developed into a statesman-like leader whose strong qualities are admired by his players, peers and supporters.
"He's obviously had a phenomenal career as a player, but I would certainly say there has been a public change in his confidence being in the captain's role," former Ryder Cup player Oliver Wilson, who has known Donald since they played US college golf together, told BBC Sport.
"He has realised he's really good at this and there are so many reasons why he's really good at this."
Donald is described as a natural introvert by those who know him well, but they say he also carries an air of assurance which he transmits to his players.
That is considered his greatest asset.
Donald is regarded as a good communicator and ensuring everyone in the European camp knew their role bred confidence they would achieve their goal of beating the Americans in their Bethpage bearpit - where the visitors faced torrid abuse.
"When I was talking to some of the vice-captains earlier in the week, I was blown away by the confidence," Wilson added.
"It was a quiet confidence, but it genuinely caught me off guard. Normally people are a a little cagey. There was none of that.
"It was more like 'we are going to win, we are the better team, this is why we are going to win, we're just going to execute our plan'.
"I've never experienced that in a Ryder Cup environment. I was even fired up."
Donald's playing CV - a former world number one and four-time Ryder Cup winner - is another integral ingredient in his successful leadership.
Through his stature and amenable nature, he has been able to enhance a team spirit already fostered by friendships, but without the need for bonding sessions which feel forced.
"The players respect him so much. Luke has got to know his players inside out and having virtually the same team helps," Catriona Matthew, a two-time Solheim Cup-winning captain with home and away wins in 2019 and 2021, told BBC Sport.
"But he's still been out there at so many events over the past two years and talking to the players regularly. You've got to get that connection with the team.
"If the players see how much you put into it as a captain, they respect you all the more. The best captains make it about the team rather than them."
Jose Maria Olazabal - the Spanish legend who was one of five Europe vice-captains - agrees Donald's close relationship with his players was a defining factor.
"From the start he was sending regular messages and motivating the players. In that regard the way the players were prepared was top class," he told BBC Sport.
Donald 'so proud' of his European team
As soon as Donald's reappointment was confirmed, it was quickly back to business.
Donald and Guy Kinnings, the chief executive of the European DP World Tour, decided on a subtle but key change to the approach for New York - the trip could not be treated in the same manner as a home match.
Part of that process was flying the team out to Bethpage together after most competed at the DP World Tour's flagship PGA Championship event at Wentworth.
Golfing superstars are not exempt from suffering from jetlag, so going out almost two weeks before Friday's opening day meant they were fully in sync when the action started.
Spending more time on Long Island enabled extra preparation on the ground.
The European team could suss out the lay of the land at Bethpage Black - a daunting course which has hosted major championships - and work out the all-important partnerships.
"Going out early was one of the best things they've done â and I'm amazed it took so long to do it," said Wilson, who played in Europeâs 2008 defeat in Valhalla.
"This is an extremely tiring week and being jetlagged is not conducive to performing at your best.
"There is so many things you have to do at a Ryder Cup  â events at night, signing sessions, team photos, media, press, all sorts of things â you'd get done at 10:30pm and then up at 4:30/5am.
"So in the first week, they get the pairings done, figure out golf ball-wise who is doing what, talk through the strategy, see the course.
"All their work is done so when they rock up to play they can take it easier."
Europe sneak past US in sensational Ryder Cup
Ryder Cup fan behaviour unacceptable - McIlroy
Golf is no different to any other top-level sport in terms of the deep analysis which it relies on.
Donald wanted to take the number-crunching to another level. He headed into Moneyball territory.
That's why he appointed Edoardo Molinari, a team-mate in Europe's 2010 win at Celtic Manor, as one of his vice-captains.
The 44-year-old Italian is known throughout the game for his approach to analytics and has been heavily leaned on by Donald.
"I'm going to give a lot of props to Edoardo," Donald said in his team's winning news conference on Sunday.
"Edoardo and I sit down and we chat for many, many hours about all the kind of different stats and the pairings and the personalities and the course fits."
Molinari graduated from a five-year engineering degree before turning professional and founded a statistic-based company in 2020.
The firm describes its database as "golf's most advanced analytics for tour players", a claim supported by many of the European Ryder Cup players using it.
The depth of Molinari's work is illustrated by his team's analysis of driving statistics.
We've shut up a lot of people - McIlroy
The PGA Tour takes two drives from every player's round from holes faced in opposite directions to counteract the effect of wind. Molinari's team analyse every shot taken with a driver.
"If you look at the PGA Tour stats, they say the US team is longer off the tee. But Edoardo's stats present a more accurate representation of both teams - they say the European team is longer," said Wilson.
"So you look at the Bethpage course and the US have cut the rough down â that completely plays into the European hands.
"The US team are better on approach play but they are losing the advantage because Europe were hitting it further and can still play from the rough.
"Using Scottie Scheffler as an example, he was hamstrung to a degree because his strength is getting the ball in play off the tee.
"He's getting the ball in play but he's not getting the advantage because the European team can play from the rough."
Bradley wants Ryder Cup rule changed after defeat
Has any great leader ever referenced hotel shampoo when asked for details about their leadership strategy? They have now.
Donald is famous for his attention to detail and provided fascinating insight into how he leaves no stone unturned.
When the team arrived at their hotel in Garden City, a salubrious Long Island village 12 miles to the west of Bethpage, things were not quite up to scratch.
A crack in the doors to each room let in too much light. The bedding was not as comfortable as hoped. And the shampoo did not smell fragrant enough.
Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry, two of the more follicly-challenged players, rubbed their heads in agreement.
"My job is literally to give these guys a better chance to win. It can be as simple as some very small things," said Donald, who arranged for European sporting greats including Roger Federer and former NBA basketball player Pau Gasol to provide motivational messages to the team.
"It's just taking the time and having the care that you want to do everything you can to kind of give these guys the best opportunity.
"You want to create an environment where they can succeed. These are 12 amazing players, we know that.
"You're just trying to put them in a position where they feel comfortable."
When Donald and his players stood on the victory podium with the Ryder Cup, a familiar chant returned.
Thousands of European fans gathered behind the stage pleaded for Donald to serve another term at Adare Manor in 2027 and were joined by the jubilant players.
A coy Donald shook his head.
"I'm not sure my heart can take it," he smiled.
Given the amount of time and effort he has put into the job, you have to wonder if he does have enough energy to devote to another tilt.
Unsurprisingly, his future cropped up in the post-match news conference.
With his surrounding players restarting the chant, Donald was asked what his response would be if the question was posed from the European tour.
"My answer is I'm going to enjoy tonight," he said.
Maybe Kinnings should collar Donald when he has sunk a few celebratory beers. Two more years?


===== Friendships: How to deal with 'energy-vampires'
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceq20p1nr88o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Got an energy vampire in your life?
This isn't a supernatural being that craves blood; energy-vampires refer to friends who seem to zap your energy when you spend time with them.
These people may complain a lot, only talk about themselves and show no real interest in you or your life.
So how do you spot them?
Common signs are an excessive need for attention and reassurance, according to psychologist and author Suzy Reading.
They may also chip away at your mood slowly, through backhanded compliments or pressuring you to be upbeat, where they don't allow you to express how you are really feeling.
Author and journalist Radhika Sanghani says how you feel after meeting these kinds of people is often the telltale sign.
"I've come away and thought, this isn't working, I'm really drained, and I'm able to see it's them, they are the problem, not me."
If this is an issue you're struggling with, here are three ways to handle it.
Many people may not realise how their behaviour is impacting you.
It could be an awkward conversation, but speaking up and telling them directly how you feel can be very effective.
"There are plenty of examples where people have been given that feedback and they've been aghast. They've had no idea about the impact their behaviour has had on other people," says Suzy.
This kind of honesty can help you maintain a friendship.
Radhika suggests a conversation along the lines of: "When we're hanging out, I'm not really feeling that there's much space for me. I don't feel heard. I'm not really being asked any questions."
If they're a real friend, they will listen to what you're saying and not ignore it.
"If they instantly deny it or are defensive, that to me shows they're not someone I want in my life," she says.
If your friend shows no desire to change their behaviour and you cannot extricate yourself from each other's lives, it is important to put in place clear boundaries to protect yourself.
This could be by cutting down the time you spend with them or setting rules for when you are together.
"Be clear on what's okay and what's not okay.
"For example, 'you can say 'let's not send endless messages' or 'we're not going to talk about our emotional lives,'" says Suzy.
Changing what you do when you spend time together can also help. If you normally go out for a meal together and chat or have regular coffees, try a different activity.
"Why don't you go for a walk together? Why don't you exercise together so you're still having your needs met? That dials down their tendency to just dominate everything," suggests Suzy.
Pay close attention to how you feel after you've met up with a friend.
"If you've had a social encounter, think: Was it a +2? Did you come away feeling lifted? Was it a zero? Or was it a –2, where they're draining you?"
You may have a different tolerance to someone else, so need to trust your own judgement on whether to start limiting your time with them.
And, if it feels irreparable, Radhika says you shouldn't be afraid of calling time on the relationship.
"In some situations, if it's easy enough, I will just withdraw, especially if it's someone I've just met."

===== Terry Farrell, architect who designed MI6 building, dies aged 87
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe2v471r03o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Sir Terry Farrell, one of the UK's leading architects, has died at the age of 87.
Farrells, the architecture practice he founded, announced his death "with deep sadness", saying: "Terry was frequently called a maverick, radical and a non-conformist which he relished."
His typical building style was post-modernist, exuberant and playful, with his famous commissions including London's MI6 building and the headquarters for ITV's 1980s breakfast show TV-am, with giant breakfast eggcups perched on the roof.
Farrells added that the architect's "enduring commitment to urbanism has helped shape government policy on key built environment issues".
Sir Terry was born in 1938, and like many architects of his generation, he was blown away by the modernist buildings of America he encountered when he travelled to the US on a scholarship in the 1960s.
In 1965, he went into practice with Nicholas Grimshaw, who became another international architecture superstar, and who died earlier this month .
To begin with, the pair's practice focused on sleek, stripped-down buildings with little or no ornament, in which a structure's function was meant to dictate its form.
One of their first designs was an aluminium-clad block of flats in north London. Built for a housing association, it was known to taxi drivers as the sardine can, and both architects and their families took flats there.
But while Grimshaw remained true to the hi-tech minimalist creed, Farrell increasingly felt pulled in a different direction. In 1980 they parted and Farrell established his own practice.
His breakthrough came in 1982 with the headquarters for TV-am in a repurposed canalside warehouse in north London's Camden.
It was colourful and over-the-top, full of witty references to the architecture of the past, like a pastiche of a Japanese temple, a Mesopotamian ziggurat (temple tower) and a massive cartoon cutout keystone, suspended in a skeletal arch of brightly coloured tubular steel over the entrance.
But what caught the popular imagination were the giant breakfast eggcups on the roof overlooking the canal.
Sir Terry later described the project as a "tremendous release", and the Royal Academy called it a "pop building, through its sheer abundance of metaphor".
But arguably his most famous building was the MI6 headquarters next to Vauxhall Bridge in London, which has featured in several James Bond films.
Completed in 1994, Farrell later claimed that when the building was being designed he was told only that it was for a government client.
He guessed (wrongly) that it might be for the Department of the Environment, which is why this towering edifice of mirrored green glass and Italian marble, part-1930s Art Deco factory, part-Aztec temple, has conical fir trees half way up the facade.
He gained a reputation for making big buildings fun, adding Lego-like decorative touches to developments like the Edinburgh International Conference Centre and Embankment Place above Charing Cross Station in London.
"The modernism that was around before the 1980s was very grey, restrictive, utilitarian and quite doctrinaire really," Farrell said.
"For me personally the split from Grimshaw was an opportunity to completely start again. I saw it as a great release to establish a new identity any way I saw fit."
He was also keen on innovation and environmental awareness, including the £4.6m Farrell Centre, which opened in Newcastle in 2023 .
It held an exhibition showing how we might soon be able to grow buildings from fungus, and other innovative ways to reduce cities' environmental impact.
Partly funded by Sir Terry, the exhibition showed four architecture studios offering visions for making buildings more sustainable.
They included a structure grown from mycelium, the root network of fungus.
Outside London, Sir Terry also built Hull's striking aquarium, The Deep, jutting out over the Humber like a strangely angular boat; and the eclectic collection of buildings known as The Centre for Life in Newcastle.
He also developed a substantial practice overseas, especially in China, where he designed buildings that managed to be both gargantuan and frisky.
One of the earliest was the Peak Tower in Hong Kong in 1997, an upturned crescent perched atop four concrete legs (since glassed in to provide additional space).  It's reminiscent of a cooking wok or the upswept eaves of a Chinese temple.
His Beijing South and Guangzhou South railway stations are among the largest in the world, and the KK100 tower in Shenzhen was the tallest building designed by a British architect.
Not all of his work was quite so exuberant.
A new building in London for the Home Office was unusually restrained. He was also adept at marrying modern elements with historic buildings, as at London's Royal Institution and Newcastle's Great North Museum.
Much of his work referenced architectural styles of the past.
Although his own buildings sometimes faced a backlash from critics who thought post-modernism belonged firmly in the 1980s, he maintained that the modernists had been wrong to throw away the history books.


===== Claire's saved in rescue deal but 1,000 jobs remain at risk
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cder59gzx5xo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

The future of fashion accessory chain Claire's has been secured in the UK with the sale of more than half of its stores, but doubts remain over the fate of its remaining shops and jobs.
Modella Capital, which bought the WH Smith High Street stores , has agreed to purchase "substantially most" of Claire's UK, the joint administrators confirmed.
The new deal will save approximately 1,000 jobs and 156 stores, but 145 other stores are not included in the deal.
Interpath, which led the sales process, said there were about 1,000 employees across those stores that were not transferring to Modella.
Claire's collapsed into administration in the UK and Ireland on 13 August, putting 2,150 jobs at risk.
The chain had been particularly popular for its ear piercing services and was a common stop in the early 2000s for tweens and teens during weekend shopping trips across the world.
Its stores are known for their colourful selection of hair bands, earrings, jewellery, and occasionally for toys such as slime and fluffy collectables.
Natasha Harbinson, Interpath's managing director, said: "We are pleased to confirm a sale of the majority of Claire's UK business and assets which will ensure this popular brand will continue to trade on High Streets up and down the UK."
The UK stores not currently included in the deal will remain open and will continue to trade while the administrators continue to assess their options.
Will Wright, Interpath's UK chief executive and joint administrator, added: "Our intention is to continue to trade the remaining portfolio of stores for as long as we can, while we explore the options available."
Joe Price, managing director at Modella Capital, said: "We strongly believe this much-loved brand deserves the chance to remain on the High Street in the UK and Ireland."
Mr Price said Claire's was facing "significant" issues and Modella Capital would need to "work collaboratively with all interested parties" if the rescue plan was to succeed.
Ms Harbinson said that the administrators had also secured a sale of the Claire's business in Switzerland, while discussions will continue regarding the fate of other Claire's entities in France, Italy and Poland.
On 20 August, Claire's announced it had sold its North American business to private equity firm Ames Watson for $104m (£77m) and revealed it would close 290 stores in the US.
In March, Modella Capital bought more than 480 WH Smith stores located in retail parks, shopping centres and on High Streets, including 5,000 staff.
The sale came after WH Smith decided it would focus on its stores at airports, railway stations and hospitals.
Since that deal, Modella Capital has been rebranding the High Street stores as TGJones.

===== Super Bowl 2026: Bad Bunny to perform at half-time show
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wdqrv00k0o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Puerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny will headline next year's Super Bowl half-time show in California.
The singer and rapper, who has topped Spotify's most-streamed artist list in three of the past five years, will squeeze his hits into less than 15 minutes on US TV's most-watched night in February.
In a football-themed statement, he said: "What I'm feeling goes beyond myself. It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown. This is for my people, my culture, and our history."
It comes after the star recently said in an interview with i-D magazine he is avoiding the US on his current world tour out of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents might conduct raids on fans at his concerts.
He will now make a trip to the US for Super Bowl night in Santa Clara on 8 February.
He will follow in the footsteps of other recent half-time performers including Kendrick Lamar , Usher, Rihanna and The Weeknd.
Lamar was the musical attraction at this year's Super Bowl, which was watched by a record 127 million viewers in the US.
Switching into his native Spanish, Bad Bunny - whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio - added in his statement: "Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el halftime show del Super Bowl" - which roughly translates as: "Go tell your grandma we're going to be the Super Bowl half-time show."
Jay-Z, whose Roc Nation company chooses the half-time performer and produces their show, said what Bad Bunny has "done and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring".
"We are honoured to have him on the world's biggest stage," he added.
In 2022, Bad Bunny Un Verano Sin Ti (A Summer Without You), became the first all-Spanish language album to reach number one in the US.
The 31-year-old was the third most-streamed artist in the world last year, behind Taylor Swift and The Weeknd.
He released his latest album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos), earlier this year.
He has won three Grammy Awards, and earlier this month was revealed as the leading nominee at this year's Latin Grammy Awards.
Earlier this month, he concluded a residency in his native Puerto Rico, which drew more than 500,000 fans. Puerto Rico is a US territory but which exercises substantial internal self-govenance.
His tour is due to start in the Dominican Republic in November, before travelling across Central and South America, then to Australia, Japan and Europe, including two nights at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London next summer.
"There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate - I've performed there many times," the star explained to i-D about the absence of US dates.
"All of [the shows] have been successful. All of them have been magnificent. I've enjoyed connecting with Latinos who have been living in the US."
He continued: "But there was the issue of... ICE could be outside [my concerts]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about."
His Super Bowl performance will take place at the Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Bad Bunny is also an actor, appearing in films like Bullet Train and the recent Happy Gilmore 2.
And he will return to host Saturday Night Live for a second time next month.

===== Fresh call from Uist vets for controls on remote St Kilda's sheep
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr5jwn71y5o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Two vets have renewed their appeal for greater protection for a rare breed of sheep that lives on a remote Scottish archipelago.
Soay roam wild on St Kilda and are descended from animals first brought to the group of small islands and rocky sea stacks thousands of years ago.
David Buckland and Graham Charlesworth say that on the main island of Hirta, hundreds of sheep starve to death every winter due to a lack of grazing. They want the animals' numbers controlled.
But National Trust for Scotland (NTS), which owns St Kilda, and the Scottish government say the sheep are wild animals and do not come under welfare laws that protect farm animals.
The Uist-based vets previously organised a petition calling for the sheep to be looked after in a more managed way.
Sheep were first brought to St Kilda in prehistoric times, and the rare breed is named after the archipelago's small, uninhabited island of Soay.
The animals are small and their fleeces have a wide range of colours and shades, including dark brown.
Sheep taken from Soay were raised as livestock on Hirta, the largest island, until the last inhabitants abandoned St Kilda in 1930 , taking their animals with them.
In the years that followed, about 100 sheep were moved from Soay to Hirta.
Today there are more than 1,800 sheep on Hirta, according to the latest figures of the University of Edinburgh's St Kilda Soay Sheep Project .
The project has been gathering data since 1985.
Vets David Buckland and Graham Charlesworth argue that the sheep are not native to St Kilda and have undergone thousands of years of domestication, so should treated the same way as sheep on farms are.
They said their analysis of the St Kilda Soay Sheep Project's figures suggested more than 1,000 sheep, which included lambs, had died in some years.
They claimed yearly mortality rates on average were seldom lower than 400.
Mr Buckland said small numbers should be taken off Hirta each year to reduce the population.
He said this would provide adequate grazing in winter for the animals left on the island.
He told BBC Alba's Eòrpa programme: "In some ways for a vet it's not the numbers dying, it's the manner of dying.
"Starvation is not a good death and it's the suffering that concerns us."
Mr Buckland added: "The problem is the lack of grazing in winter and the lack of control of the population.
"We are not looking for intensive farming, we are just looking at measures to reduce the suffering and reduce the numbers dying from starvation."
Mr Charlesworth, now a retired vet, said: "Pain and suffering is natural but cruelty is a human concept and really that is sort of what you are seeing happening out there."
The Scottish government said St Kilda's flock was protected by the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 , the same protection given to Scotland's wild deer population.
A spokesperson said: "The Soay sheep on St Kilda are considered wild animals due to their unique history of adapting to life without management for many generations."
Diarmaid Hearns, of NTS, said St Kilda's remote location would make managing the sheep challenging.
He added: "It would be a real change in thinking from government for them to be reclassified.
"We are always interested in what other people's views are and if times change then we will change with them."
Prof Josephine Pemberton, who ran the St Kilda Soay Sheep Project for many years, said intervention could lead to the population becoming less resilient to disease and parasites.
She added: "Winter mortality of lambs removes inbred individuals, removes bad genes, so the flock has this purging thing the whole time which I don't think we would be able to organise."
St Kilda is more than 40 miles (64km) west of the Western Isles.
Hirta is inhabited but only on a temporary basis by visiting NTS workers, scientists and also contractors who work at small Ministry of Defence site.


===== The Wayne Rooney Show: Ex-Manchester United striker says he has 'no faith' in Ruben Amorim - BBC Sport

'I don't recognise the football club' - Rooney's Man Utd despair
Wayne Rooney believes the soul has gone from his former club Manchester United and he has no faith in manager Ruben Amorim to turn things around.
United's record goalscorer said the club was "broken" on the latest edition of BBC podcast The Wayne Rooney Show, and he goes to games "expecting" them to lose.
Manchester United's 3-1 defeat at Brentford on Saturday meant they have collected 34 points from Amorim's 33 league games in charge and have still to win successive matches.
The club are said to remain supportive of their head coach despite the damaging loss which left them 14th in the Premier League table.
But Rooney added that some current players "don't deserve to wear the shirt",  the side "needs a new engine" and supporters are "waiting for the club to crumble".
"I am not seeing anything which is giving me any confidence, there needs to be big changes in my opinion," said the former England striker, who won five league titles during 13 years at Old Trafford.
"Manager, players, whatever that is. Whatever it takes to get Manchester United back."

Latest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views
United finished 15th in the Premier League last season, their worst finish to a top-flight campaign since they were relegated from the old First Division in 1973-74.
Amorim took charge of United last November having lifted the Portuguese title with Sporting in successive seasons.
Defeat at Brentford meant the Red Devils are winless in their last eight Premier League away games (two draws and six losses), their longest run since 2019.
They last enjoyed back-to-back league victories between May and August 2024.
"There needs to be a clear message from the owners," added Rooney.
"Whether that is the Glazers, [minority owner] Sir Jim Ratcliffe, there has to be a message of where this club is going. At the minute we are all sitting there waiting for it to crumble.
"The culture of that football club has gone. I see it on a daily basis. I see staff losing jobs, people walking out of jobs.
"I've got two kids [in the academy] at that football club and I really hope this doesn't affect what they're doing. What I'm seeing at that football club is not Manchester United."

How Amorim's constant changes made it hard for Man Utd
After the disappointing defeat by Brentford, Amorim said: "I am never concerned about my job - I am not that kind of guy."
The Portuguese, 40, has been criticised for his stubbornness in sticking with his favoured 3-4-2-1 formation.
Speaking on BBC Match of the Day, ex-Manchester City and England defender Micah Richards said those tactics could lead to "his undoing" and Premier League record goalscorer Alan Shearer said Amorim was fortunate to have avoided the sack.
"I just don't know what's going on," admitted ex-Birmingham City, Derby County and Plymouth Argyle boss Rooney, 39.
"I have tried my hand in management and it didn't work out too well, I get it. Ruben Amorim is my age, he is still a young manager and I'm sure he still has a massive future, but what's going on at Man Utd, this is not Man Utd.
"I honestly hope he can turn it round and he does. But if you're saying to me, 'do you believe he will?', then, after everything I've seen, honestly, I've got no faith in it."
Amorim 'never concerned' about job at Man Utd
The former England skipper, who also captained United, added: "I don't recognise the whole football club. I don't see players fighting, I don't see character, I don't see desire to win.
"I go to a game watching, expecting, here we go again - expecting the team to lose or maybe pick up a point.
"It's not even just results on the pitch. It's everything about the club that needs fixing - Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos have walked into a real challenge.
"We're seeing staff members getting sacked after 20, 30 years who are very important people to that football club.
"The soul has gone from the club. It needs a new engine, a new lease of life. It needs something to kickstart that football club."
Ratcliffe's Ineos Group bought a 27.7% stake in United in February 2024 worth about Â£1.25bn ($1.6bn).
The overall number of employees has dropped from 1,100 to 700 in the past two years following controversial redundancies.
The Glazer family, who have owned the 20-time English top-flight champions since 2005, retain a majority stake, but Ineos have taken control of the club's football operations.

===== Matt Beard: Inquest opened into death of former Liverpool boss  - BBC Sport
URL: https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cwyrvndg9eyo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Matt Beard had two spells as manager of Liverpool
Former Liverpool women manager Matt Beard was found hanged at his home, a coroner's court hearing has been told.
At a hearing on Monday in Ruthin, North Wales, coroner John Gittins said paramedics were called to Beard's home in Deeside, Flintshire, before he was taken to hospital.
Beard, 47, died in hospital in Chester at 21:15 BST on 20 September. The hearing was adjourned for a full inquest at a later date.
Beard led Liverpool to back-to-back Women's Super League (WSL) titles in 2013 and 2014.
He returned for a second spell at the club in 2021 but was sacked in February this year.
Beard's last role was at Burnley, where he resigned in June after just two months in charge.
Since his death there has been an outpouring of support from within the game.
A minute's silence took place in tribute to Beard before kick-off in all WSL and WSL2 games on Sunday, 21 September. Liverpool's match against Aston Villa was postponed.
Manchester United manager Marc Skinner described Beard as an "icon" and England legend Fara Williams said Beard was "one of a kind and had the purest of souls".
A fundraiser to support his family organised by journalist Jacqui Oatley has raised more than Â£50,000.

===== Chris Woakes: England all-rounder retires from international cricket - BBC Sport
URL: https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cly1xz5zq7ro?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss

Woakes made his England Test debut at the Oval against Australia in 2013
England all-rounder Chris Woakes has retired from international cricket following his omission from this winter's Ashes squad.
The 36-year-old played 62 Test matches, 122 one-day internationals and 33 T20s for his country.
Woakes was part of the England team which won the 50-over 2019 World Cup in a thrilling final against New Zealand at Lord's, as well as the T20 World Cup in 2022.
The Warwickshire player made his England debut in a T20 match in 2011 and played his first Test in the final match of the 2013 Ashes series.
Woakes was part of the England side that drew 2-2 in a captivating Test series against India this summer.
He suffered a suspected dislocated shoulder on the first day of the fifth Test and came out to bat with his left arm in a sling on the final day.
England needed 17 runs when Woakes came out at number 11. He did not face a ball but ran four runs before Gus Atkinson was bowled.
England give surprise Ashes call to spinner Jacks
Can you name players with 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in Test cricket?
Woakes finishes with a Test record of 192 wickets at an average of 29.61 and 2,034 runs at an average of 25.11.
In ODIs, he took 173 wickets and scored 1,524 runs, while he took 31 wickets and scored 147 runs in T20s.
"Playing for England was something I aspired to do since I was a kid dreaming in the back garden, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have lived out those dreams," he wrote on social media.
"Representing England, wearing the Three Lions and sharing the field with team-mates over the last 15 years, many of whom have become lifelong friends, are things I'll look back on with the greatest pride.
"Making my debut in 2011 in Australia seems like yesterday, but time flies when you're having fun.
"Lifting two World Cups and being part of some amazing Ashes series is something I never thought was possible, and those memories and celebrations with my team-mates will stay with me forever.
"I look forward to continuing to play county cricket and exploring more franchise opportunities in the near future."
Woakes played in all five Tests against India in the summer
Woakes received the Compton-Miller Medal - awarded to the player of the series - for his role in the 2023 Ashes when he took 19 wickets at 18.14 in his three matches.
"Chris Woakes is one of the finest people to have played the game," said Rob Key, managing director of England men's cricket.
"An extraordinary career carved out alongside two of England's greatest ever bowlers [James Anderson and Stuart Broad].
"A man who helped every team he played in, even before he walked on to the field."
ECB chair Richard Thompson added: "The images of Chris walking out to bat with his arm in a sling to try and win a Test match this summer reflected how much he cared about playing for his country and being the best team-mate he could be.
"He has been a gentleman off the field, with the skills and fierce determination to win on it, regularly rising to the occasion on the biggest stage with bat as well as ball.
"We are indebted to have players like Chris represent England and I want to thank and congratulate him for everything he has done in an England shirt for the past 14 years."
Gautam Gambhir was India's head coach for their series in England this summer and he praised Woakes as the "man with an iron will".
He added: "You will be remembered as one of the bravest to ever walk the field Chris."
When Chris Woakes emerged to bat with his arm in a sling in the final Test against India, there was the suspicion it would be his final act in an England shirt.
Whether or not he made it to the Ashes, and regardless of the result, it seemed likely England would want to go in a new direction at the beginning of next summer. Still, it feels incredibly cruel that such a great career would end that way.
In other eras, Woakes' achievements would have earned greater recognition. His misfortune was to coincide with James Anderson and Stuart Broad as new-ball competitors, and Ben Stokes as an all-rounder.
Maligned as not being quick enough when he made his Test debut in the fifth Ashes Test in 2013, Woakes went on to become one of the most lethal bowlers to perform in English conditions. While his struggles overseas were well known, a home average of 23.87 outstrips Anderson and Broad.
At Lord's, the most famous ground of all, he had few peers. Only five other men have matched Woakes' record of registering a Test hundred, five-wicket haul and 10-wicket haul at the home of cricket.
In an era of English cricketing ups and downs, Woakes has seen it all. In that golden era of white-ball cricket, when England were simultaneously world champions in both formats, Woakes was one of only four men to play in both the 50-over World Cup final of 2019 and T20 final in 2022. Overall, he is one of only six England players to have won both World Cups and the Ashes.
His exit is a further departure from the group that formed the core of the England team throughout much of the previous decade and the beginning of this one. Moeen Ali has retired, Jonny Bairstow is out of favour, Jos Buttler now only in the white-ball set-up. Anderson and Broad are gone, Stokes and Mark Wood are nearer the end than the start. Joe Root, at least, looks like he has plenty of time left.
It is a shame that Woakes will not be afforded a proper send-off, but perhaps that unforgettable moment at The Oval was a fitting farewell for the ultimate team man.
Plenty will say that Woakes is the nicest man in cricket, and they would be right. On that Monday morning in August, he also showed that he is the bravest.

===== Europe win Ryder Cup: Rory McIlroy hits out at 'unacceptable' behaviour after wife hit by drink - BBC Sport

We've shut up a lot of people - McIlroy
Rory McIlroy has hit out at the "unacceptable and abusive behaviour" at the Ryder Cup after his wife Erica was hit by a drink thrown by an American fan in New York.
The incident happened on the 17th tee at Bethpage during McIlroy's Saturday afternoon match alongside his good friend Shane Lowry.
"It should be off-limits, but it wasn't this week," said the Northern Irishman after Europe's 15-13 win over the United States on Sunday.
"Erica is fine. She's a strong woman. She handled everything this week with class and poise and dignity like she always has. I love her and we're going to have a good time celebrating [this win]."
Lowry added: "I was out there for two days with Erica McIlroy, and the amount of abuse that she received was astonishing."
How a dramatic end to the Ryder Cup unfolded
McIlroy, the world number two, said the Ryder Cup victory capped "the best year of my career" after also winning the Masters to complete the career Grand Slam of all four major titles, plus the Irish Open.
He is normally adored by American fans, given he plays on the PGA Tour, but this week he bore the brunt of the barbs.
A hostile crowd in New York had been anticipated and after a reasonably quiet opening day on Friday, the abuse began to fly on Saturday as Europe opened up a seven-point lead.
McIlroy eventually snapped and swore at a spectator who called out while he was addressing the ball.
"I chirped back because it got to me a few times, but we tried to handle everything that came our way with class and poise, and for the most part, I felt like we did that," he said.
"It was a rough week for all of us. But at the same time, we shut them up by our performance."

Watch: Rory McIlroy reflects after helping Europe win the Ryder Cup.
The next Ryder Cup, in 2027, will be held at Adare Manor in Ireland and McIlroy is adamant that the abuse he suffered will not surface when the contest marks its 100th anniversary.
"Golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week," he said.
"Golf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people.
"Sometimes this week we didn't see that. So no, this should not be acceptable in the Ryder Cup.
"We will be making sure to say to our fans in Ireland in 2027 that what happened here this week is not acceptable."
McIlroy added that he would be "annoyed" if he was an American at the level of support directed towards the home players.
"I didn't hear a lot of shouts for Scottie [Scheffler - McIlroy's opponent on Sunday], but I heard a lot of shouts against me," he said.
"Support your players. The amount of security presence was insane. Nothing was going to happen, there wasn't going to be a physical altercation but there was a lot of language that was unacceptable and abusive behaviour.
"It's a minority. The majority are true golf fans and respectful and let both teams have the same chance to hit the shots and play a fair contest.
"But there was a small subset of people that behaved a little bit differently than that."

===== Women's Rugby World Cup: Can Red Roses build legacy with win? - BBC Sport

Lionesses 'gave us inspiration to do our part'
The immediate hours and days following England's Women's Rugby World Cup triumph have been choreographed closely.
Considering they came into the tournaments as white-hot favourites, there was no excuse for them not to be.
After a Sunday morning news conference at their Lensbury base, with orange juice being sipped tentatively between answers, the squad boarded a specially wrapped team bus to a public celebration party at Battersea Power Station.
Next weekend, the players will disperse to rugby clubs around the country to sprinkle some stardust on RugbyFest, a nationwide "open house" designed to turn new followers of the game into regular players and volunteers.
In four weeks' time, the domestic Premiership Women's Rugby (PWR) season kicks off with a front-loaded fixture list of blockbuster games.
Defending champions Gloucester-Hartpury (with Zoe Aldcroft, Natasha Hunt, Maud Muir, Alex Matthews, Tatyana Heard et al) meet Saracens (featuring Zoe Harrison, Jess Breach, Marlie Packer, Rosie Galligan and the rest) live on TNT Sports.
Ellie Kildunne's Harlequins take on Sadia Kabeya's Loughborough Lightning in the first weekly game of BBC Sport's new expanded deal with the league.
For the first time, every single top-flight match will be available to watch live, with those not shown by broadcasters being streamed on YouTube.
Finally in April, England will return to Twickenham's Allianz Stadium for successive matches for the first time, facing Ireland in their Six Nations opener.
"We've shown we can sell the tickets and people want to come and watch women's rugby," said Kildunne.
"Why wouldn't you invest into it? It's a sport that's going to keep on growing. This is just the start now. We've set a standard and we're not going to look back."

How two big gambles finally paid out in Red Roses World Cup glory

The ramp to steer new fans, who helped the final deliver a record-breaking peak audience figure of 5.8m on UK television, into the sport full-time is in place.
But, for all the optimism, 'legacy' can be elusive.
It was London 2012's ubiquitous buzzword. It was the Olympics to "inspire a generation".
Yet, a decade after, the numbers showed that all the millions spent, facilities built and sudden handball enthusiasm generated, did not translate into any discernible rise in people taking part in sport.
If anything, they were inspired to stay in, rather than join in.
A decade after England's men's side solitary Rugby World Cup triumph in 2003, it was the same story.
There were fewer players playing grassroots rugby and, for an added bonus, England had stalled and slipped back at the elite level as well.
On that occasion, an opportunity was wasted.
Can England's rugby heroes inspire more girls to stay in sport?
It was estimated that 500,000 turned out for the 2003 Rugby World Cup winners' victory parade
Local clubs had not been geared up for the sudden rush of Jonny Wilkinson wannabes that descended on them after his drop-kick landed World Cup glory.
There was a lack of coaches, equipment and facilities to harness those young dreams.
This time should be different. The Rugby Football Union has pre-loaded the legacy.
Impact 25 - a four-year investment and development programme - began in March 2022.
By its end, it will have distributed more than Â£14.5m of government funding to areas where it will be most effective in getting women and girls into rugby.
At the latest count, it had supported more than 850 clubs and trained 3,385 female coaches and match officials. Since it started, there has been a 35% increase in age-grade girl players in England.
As that number jumps up, the grassroots game should, in theory, be ready to capitalise. , external
For those already at the top of the club game, there could also be changes afoot.
Because, even amid the euphoria of his side's World Cup win, head coach John Mitchell sounded a warning.
"I just love seeing 100 English girls playing in PWR," he said. "I'd love to see more play, then I can have the opportunity to even select more.
"The league is a great competition because we're playing against other world-class players, but we've still got to be mindful that we've got to grow our English players.
"We can dominate the world for a long time, but the world's going to get better because people are starting to recognise how to resource their programmes."

Canada captain Alex Tessier is one of a raft of overseas stars who ply their trade in the PWR
Protectionism may be coming to the PWR.
As in the men's Prem, teams must pick a minimum number of England-qualified players. It is set at 13 for each 23-strong matchday squad.
However, that leaves enough room for other nations to use the PWR's world-leading playing standards to develop their own players.
Eight of Canada's starting XV from the final play in the PWR, including Saracens' Sophie de Goede and Exeter's Alex Tessier. In total, 17 of their World Cup squad play in England.
The equivalent number for the United States is 14.
Even the Black Ferns, traditionally a home-grown squad, are starting to make the trip. Ealing Trailfinders have signed New Zealand internationals Georgia Ponsonby and Alana Borland (nee Bremner) for the start of next season.
While those overseas names bring some sparkle to the league - the effect of Ilona Maher's three-month stint at Bristol Bears was immediate and startling - the ratio may be tweaked to ensure future Red Roses have the space they need to bloom.
For those already at the top, there is a chance to embed themselves and their sport more deeply in mainstream culture. And make some money while doing so.
A report by sports marketing agency Two Circles estimated that Kildunne, as the most recognisable face of the team, could make between Â£300,000 and Â£500,000 on the back of her team's World Cup win.
Bookers for chat show sofas and celebrity television will have taken note of a squad who, often by necessity, have grown a sizeable social media presence.
A top-level Red Roses contract is worth approximately Â£50,000 a year, supplemented by bonuses, such as Â£20,000 for winning the final. Few will begrudge them the chance to add to that while they are in the spotlight.
In the midst of the World Cup, a remodelled WXV Global Series was unveiled to give women's rugby's top nations more freedom to carve out fixture lists and rivalries that keep interest high.
But, perhaps the most unexpected sign of women's rugby's upward trend however, came nine days earlier in a sleek office campus in California.
